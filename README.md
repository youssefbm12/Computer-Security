# SecureChatV2

This project was made in java and requires some libraries to run. The libraries are imported via Maven and are already present inside the JAR files.
The login procedure is very simple we have 4 accounts each with an username, password and secret key for the 2 factor authentication. The 2 factor authentication is done with the aid of google libraries and the code can be easible obtainable via the google authentication app.
All this information is stored inside and encrypted file (using 3DES encryption) inside the jar.
There are to executables: a server and a client.

Considering that the opposing teams should not read this readme I will attach the 4 users details to log in for testing.
